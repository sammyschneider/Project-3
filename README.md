Project #3: Restaraunts on the go

Link to live site: https://restaurantsonthego.herokuapp.com/

Functionality: Created a Full Stack application that utilizes Zomato API. This app allows users to create their favorite restaurants with full CRUD as well as it integrates two related schemas. Users can also search by city and the app renders the top 10 most popular restaurants in that city. The user can then create reviews for the restaraunts. All functions with full CRUD/routes. The site is deployed via heroku and the database is Mongo Atlas. 

Technologies used: MongoDB, Node.js, Express, React, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Mongoose

Approach taken: Our approach was that we wanted a fully functional food review app. We approached the app with the idea that users can type in a city and create reviews for those places. They also can create a favorite restaurant section. 

Unsolved problems: The next step in our project would be to add authentication via bcrypt.
